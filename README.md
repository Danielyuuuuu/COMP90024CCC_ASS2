# Twitter Data Analysis

The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the world into chaos. As highlighted by WHO: “The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating”[1]. What’s more concerning is the rollout of vaccination is slow in many countries due reasons like distrust or fear of side effects. In this project, we attempt to understand the covid impact to australia cities and people’s attitudes towards vaccination using tweet data, and also provide insight on the socio-economic drivers that may have shaped those sentiments.

We utilized resources in Melbourne research cloud and open-stack computing framework to build our system. The system is capable of harvesting and processing tweet data of interested areas and providing sentiment results and insights through an interactive web interface. We hope the insights obtained from this project will be useful in shaping government policies and guidelines to battle against Covid efficiently.
